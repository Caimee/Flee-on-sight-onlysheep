# 🐑 Flee on Sight
Your animals are now introverts ！

## Increase the difficulty of approaching wild animals, and make the experience more naturalistic.

> Sheep, cows, and pigs will now stay alert when a player approaches them.

> They sprint away until the player is far enough, and even panic as a herd when one animal bolts.

> They exhibit group behaviors, fleeing together as a pack when one gets startled.

> Approach with the food they like to flip them into a friendly state
— but hurting them will make them flee again.

> Sneak and approach from behind to get closer quietly.
